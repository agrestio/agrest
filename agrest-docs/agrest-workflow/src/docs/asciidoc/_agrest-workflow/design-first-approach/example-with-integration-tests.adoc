To run it use `mvn clean install` command.
The API description (contract) is defined in file `src/test/java/resources/api.yaml`.

All generated APIs will be located on `src/test/java` together with corresponding integration tests.

During the build time the API implementation is generated by Maven plugin and then this implementation are checked by integration tests.
We use testing fixtures from https://github.com/agrestio/agrest/tree/master/agrest[agrest] module as models.
