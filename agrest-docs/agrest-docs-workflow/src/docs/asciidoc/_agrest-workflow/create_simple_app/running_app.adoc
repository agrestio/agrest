=== Running the Application

In this chapter, we run and test our application.
After you have completed the above steps, the structure of your project will look like this:

==== Building and running

To build the application, use the `mvn clean install` command.

To run a jetty server with our application, use the mvn jetty:run command.

==== Configure IntelliJ IDEA Maven plugin

To run the application using IDE, add a new `Maven` configuration on a menu path `Run -> Edit Configurations...`.
Then set a `Name:` (e.g. *Bookstore*) and a `Command line:` in *jetty:run*

==== Testing

After running the application, you can call this endpoint to get a list of categories:

```
curl -i -X GET 'http://localhost:8080/api/category'
```

And get the following response:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:14:51 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 21
Server: Jetty(9.3.14.v20161028)

{"data":[],"total":0}
----

As you may see, the list is empty. So, use the 'POST' command to add some categories:

```
curl -i -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/category'  -d '{"id":"1","name":"Science Fiction"}'
```

Repeat the command, if necessary:

```
curl -i -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/api/category' -d '{"id":"2","name":"Horror"}'
```

The response will be:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:42:17 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 16
Server: Jetty(9.3.14.v20161028)

{"success":true}
----

Now make the 'GET' request again and you will receive the following:

[source, JSON]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Wed, 03 Oct 2018 10:44:44 GMT
Content-Type: application/json

{"data":[{"id":1,"description":null,"name":"Science Fiction"},{"id":2,"description":null,"name":"Horror"}],"total":2}
