== What is Agrest

Agrest is a set of tools to build web APIs for your data. You would use it to expose a data store
(such as a relational database) as a RESTful web service. To achieve that
goal Agrest defines a simple HTTP/JSON-based protocol
(described in <<protocol#, Agrest Protocol>>) and a server-side framework (described in <<framework#, Agrest Framework>>).
The protocol ensures that any client, be it JavaScript, a mobile
app or maybe a server-side app, can make sense of any Agrest-enabled service. The
framework is written in Java and helps you to build services adhering to the
protocol.

Agrest is open source and is distributed under the terms of
