         <title>Response: Simple Document</title>
         <para>This document is used in responses that contain no data, just a boolean status and a
            message. On success it might look like
            this:<programlisting language="json">HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "success" : true,
   "message" : "all is good"
} </programlisting>On
            failure it might look like
            this:<programlisting>HTTP/1.1 500 Server error
Content-Type: application/json    

{
   "success" : false,
   "message" : "Database connection failure"
} </programlisting></para>

      <section xml:id="protocol-collection-document">
         <title>Response: Collection Document</title>
         <para>A document that passes the data from the server to the client. This is the main
            representation of data in
            LinkRest.<programlisting>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
   "data" : [
      { "id" : 5, "name": "A" },
      { "id" : 8, "name": "B" }
   ],
   "total" : 2
}</programlisting></para>
         <para><code>"data"</code> array contains entity objects. Implicit entity model defines what
            attributes and relationships (collectively - "properties") each object has. A subset of
            properties showing in the collection document is a defined by a combination of
            server-side constraints and client request control parameters. Each object in the data
            array may contain related objects, those in turn may contain their related objects, with
            no limit on the depth of nesting.</para>
         <para><code>"total"</code> is a number of objects one would see in the collection if there
            was no pagination. If pagination is in use (see <xref linkend="protocol-start-limit"/>),
            the total may be greater than the number of visible objects in the "data" array.
            Otherwise it is equal to the size of "data".</para>

      <section xml:id="protocol-update-document">
         <title>Request: Update Document</title>
         <para>Update Document is sent from the client to the server to modify an entity collection.
            It is a Collection document stripped down to its "data" section. There are two flavors -
            a single object and an array of
            objects:<programlisting>{ "id" : 5, "name": "X" } </programlisting><programlisting>[
   { "id" : 5, "name": "X" },
   { "id" : 8, "name": "Y" }
] </programlisting></para>
