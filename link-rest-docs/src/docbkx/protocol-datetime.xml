    <title>Dates and Times</title>
      <para>JSON doesn't have datatypes for either date or time. Both are represented as strings.
         Server and client must ensure that date/time strings are in <link
            xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601 format</link>.
         E.g.:<programlisting>2015-04-19T11:08:53Z
2015-04-10T11:08
2015-04-19</programlisting></para>
      <para>Developers should not assume that the server is in the same time zone as the browser.
         All timezone-aware expressions should contain time zone offset or "Z" suffix (for "Zulu"
         time).</para>
